# Data Structure

Data structure is essentially a mechanism for logically or mathematically organizing computer memory.

A data structure, in further depth, is a particular format used to store and organize data so that any user can quickly access and work with the right data to run a program effectively.

Selecting a data format depends on two factors.
- 
1. To satisfy the relationship of the data in the real world, the data must be sufficiently rich.
2. The data structure should be so straightforward that processing the data when it is required should be simple.
Data structure characteristics
- 
1. Linear Data structure
2. Static Data structure
3. Homogenous Data structure
4. Non-Homogenous Data structure
5. Dynamic Data structure
6. Time complexity
7. Space complexity

Basic operation of data structure
- 
1. Transversing: It is used to make a single visit to each variable. It is also known as a visiting element of a data structure.
2. Searching: It is used to locate a specific piece inside the entire data structure.
3. Insertion: It's used to insert an element at a specified position in the data structure
4. Deletion: It's is used to remove an element from a specified position in the data structure
5. Sorting: It's used to arrange element in a data structure in either ascending/descending order. 
6. Merging: It's used to join two or more data structure elements to single data structure
