# Stack

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of last in first out(LIFO).This means that the element that was inputed last, will the element to come out first. 

You can see this as when you stack glasses on each other, it's the last glass that was placed upon others that will be removed firstly.  

In real life, Stack can be seen as (First Come, First Serve)
